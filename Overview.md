# An Overview to “An Introduction to Accessible Design”

## Introduction
The stipulations of United States federal funding require that organizations and educational institutions provide universal access of physical spaces and information to their employees, customers, and students. This requirement places an onus of ensuring accessibility on instructors and information technology. At NC State University, the Office of Information Technology provides support to instructors in making accessible course materials, and have expressed an interest in creating a class for students in Accessible Design. This Introduction to Accessible Design provides an example to instructors of accessible course materials, can be taught as a stand-alone class, or offers the option to include modules or specific assignments in existing classes.

Accessibility extends beyond the interactions between humans and texts or technology to the experiences of all individuals with the designed world around them. Rather than consider accessibility in such a broad definition, this syllabus is intended for students in fields that specifically focus on the development of information and communication technologies (IACT), including technical writers, distance education instructors, computer science majors, and website designers. However, because users navigate their interactions with IACT in increasingly diverse environments through the growing presence of mobile technology, augmented reality, and virtual reality, this course also incorporates case studies and projects that ask students to consider the ways that users solve problems using technology and the ways that accessibility influences that problem solving process.

The book, Disability Rhetoric, by Jay Dolmage significantly influenced the development of this course and the selection of assignments, learning objectives, and instructor education. In his analysis of rhetoric and the ‘cripping’ of rhetoric, Dolmage draws his readers through an assessment of Aristotelian rhetoric and argues that people with disability use mētis (cunning or adaptive knowledge) in their interactions with technology, the designed landscape, and society. Mētis informs the rhetoric of universal design because users adapt themselves or technology to solve problems of inaccessibility. This concept grounds Introduction to Accessible Design with the learning objective to teach students how to design with adaptability and flexibility in mind as user primary needs as opposed to considering accessibility needs as retrofitted legal requirements.

Prioritizing adaptability to user needs is the ultimate, unstated learning objective of the course. Rather than explicitly introducing the concept of mētis from the beginning, the assignments, learning objectives, and readings gradually steer students and instructors to this conclusion. Every project, case study, and reading challenges class participants to consider accessibility in a larger, cultural perspective and to apply those considerations in developing an accessible material, app, or product. Additionally, the assignments also directs participants to argue for accessible design as a business case--both for customers or end users and also for colleagues, classmates, and employees. Ultimately, these escalating challenges require students to value and incorporate people with disability in their design through either direct involvement in design initiation (invitations to speakers, focus groups, surveys, etc) or through research on secondary resources or outreach materials (activist blogs, awareness campaigns, “In my shoes” projects).

Accessibility and inclusive design fully embrace the core message of disability activism: “Not about us without us.” As the challenges from the class increase in demands and as the topics move outside the realm of standardized accessibility checklists (WCAG 2.0) into mobile accessibility, it becomes inescapable that accessible design of these technologies requires feedback from people with disability. To support this, instructions for contacting DSO and other organizations to involve volunteers with disability to speak to the class have also been included.

## Rationale

The literature has examined current practices, tested potential teaching strategies, and proposed future work in the field of accessibility pedagogy for technical communicators, engineers, and computer scientists. This project was developed to explore the specific scenario at North Carolina State University. The Office of Information Technology (OIT) is tasked with assisting instructors in designing accessible classes and course materials. In discussing these duties with Grey Reavis, who leads workshops and gives lectures on accessible course design, I volunteered to build a course that could be adapted to either an interdisciplinary class of students with varied backgrounds, used as a resource for instructors to include accessibility modules in their existing classes, and to serve as an example of accessible course design. This way, An Introduction to Accessible Design could function in a number of diverse and adaptable ways to support the needs of OIT in instructing instructors and providing modules for instructors who wanted to incorporate accessibility into their courses. Finally, should the opportunity occur to offer this class to students, the course already exists and can be used as an online or in person instruction, although in person instruction is strongly recommended.

To create this course, the overall project needed to address several questions about student learning objectives and core concepts for instructors.

  1. What is the general structure of a class on accessibility design?
  1. Where would an interdisciplinary course “live” in the curriculum?
  1. What are the necessary learning objectives for students?
  1. What concepts would instructors need to be familiar with to teach this course?
  1. How can an “Accessibility Design” course be used to both serve as an example to instructors of accessible course materials and design as  well as a template for projects and learning objectives to be incorporated into existing classwork?

## Course Structure
An Introduction to Accessible Design has been designed as a semester long class broken into smaller modules to include hands on skills, such as captioning videos and performing heuristic analysis, and also more rhetorically critical assignments such as case study analysis. Ultimately, this class aims to educate students before they move into industrial positions, and to help them in their job application process, requires them to create a project portfolio of their accessibility work. Since there are no certifications or minimum requirements for becoming an “Accessibility Expert,” having a portfolio of work strongly supports students’ claims that they are proficient in creating accessible products.

### Schedule
This course has been designed as a semester-long class that meets twice a week for 75 minutes and is intended to serve as a general class outline. Depending on the backgrounds of an interdisciplinary class, this allows flexibility for instructors to alter the schedule of the class or adapt lessons to meet specific learning interests and skill development of the students. Additionally, instructors can copy the modules or the entire class from Moodle and create their own course.

### Readings

#### Annotated Bibliography
An annotated bibliography of all readings used in this class as well as recommended readings for instructors is included in the site. These annotations give a general summary of the reading including relevant findings and then provide a short explanation of why it is included in this course on a particular day for discussion.

#### Instructor Readings
For certain class meetings, there is a “Recommended Readings for Instructor.” This resource is the primary article or necessary background for the discussion topic of the day. These readings focus either on the pedagogy of a certain topic or provide detailed background through sociological, technical, or theoretical research that may not assist students with learning but would assist an instructor in teaching.
#### Student Readings
Student readings listed provide background for the day’s discussion topic and long term progression of concepts.

### Assignments

#### Case Studies
Case studies situate the abstract design concepts discussed in class through real world event analysis. The first case study, New York City Crisis Communication, was presented in the literature as an example of a critical experience in an accessible information design course by ******. These case studies allow students to consider industrial, civic, and non-academic scenarios where accessibility matters for individuals who must solve specific problems.

#### Projects
Projects are major, graded assignments for students to complete outside of class or during class ‘workshop/ studio’ hours. These projects will prepare students for their final portfolio project by scaffolding their critical analysis of technologies and texts. Beginning with an analysis of an infomercial to identify adaptability and audience/ users, students begin user centered design assessments. Next they evaluate a website using WCAG 2.0 criteria, defining specific areas for improvement based on their heuristic and usability testing. The next project requires them to evaluate a mobile app or technology for accessibility issues, again reporting back specific areas for improvement. These projects augment in class case studies which requires students to develop a new accessibility checklist for mobile technology and also critically evaluate the impact of accessibility on users in real-world scenarios. Finally, these projects provide experience in accessible design and evaluation for their final project, which requires students to independently create an accessible product and justify their design decisions.

#### Final Portfolios
The final portfolio due as the major assignment/ final for this class includes all the projects completed during the semester as well as the final project (accessibility business case or product development). These portfolios are designed composed of these projects to serve as work examples for students to demonstrate their proficiency at both design and accessible design on the job market.

## Conclusion
The course design for An Introduction to Accessible Design responds to the suggestions in the literature, notably Browning, Cagle, Palmeri, Oswal, Youngblood, and Dolmage to integrate not only universal design for learning but also to educate students in inclusive design. This course specifically addresses the three part checklist presented by Dolmage (2015) for UDL:

  * Multiple means of representation, to give learners various ways of acquiring information and knowledge

  * Multiple means of expression, to provide learners alternatives for demonstrating what they know,

  * Multiple means of engagement, to tap into learners' interests, offer appropriate challenges, and increase motivation.

IAD provides representation through incorporating readings, videos, interviews, and discussions to facilitate learning. Expression is assessed through writing, projects, and presentations while engagement allows students to select a topic relevant to their academic interests and career goals to develop individualized projects and research. Furthermore, this checklist and  has also influenced the way that universal design is taught in this class by having students consider the ways that users require and prefer products that allow for multiple means of interaction.

To accomplish this, the IAD course has been designed to allow for multiple means of interaction between instructors and the resource by providing the information through Moodle, which will allow them to copy modules and use the materials as examples of ‘accessible materials.’
